# RockPaperScissors
game.js is my first JavaScript code that does not include DOM yet. However, the game can be played in the console part and the result can be seen as an output. The main idea behind this project was to practice writing loops in JavaScript.

event.js is a script that includes the Document Object Model (DOM). While I have practiced using event listeners extensively, there is still room for improvement in my skills. However, I am pleased that the code is functional and has helped me learn more about JavaScript. The process was challenging, but I managed to complete it successfully
